# SNR vs Distance in D2D Communication

This MATLAB project simulates the variation of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) with respect to distance in a Device-to-Device (D2D) communication scenario.

## 📈 Output
- The graph demonstrates the relationship between SNR (dB) and distance (m).
- As distance increases, SNR decreases logarithmically, consistent with real-world wireless behavior.

  ## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- MATLAB for simulation and plotting
- Git for version control
- GitHub for project hosting
  
## 💡 Summary

- **Simulation Tool:** MATLAB
- **Concepts Covered:** Path loss, SNR degradation, D2D communication
- **Input:** Range of distances
- **Output:** SNR values plotted against distance

## 🔬 Objective

To study how SNR changes with distance in a D2D environment to understand path loss effects on wireless signal quality.

## 💡 Concept
SNR decreases with increased distance due to path loss. This is modeled using the path loss exponent (η), where `SNR = SNR0 - 10ηlog10(d/d0)`.

## 🧠 Insight

This helps in efficient communication system design, particularly in ensuring robust link quality over varying distances.

## 📌 Applications
- Wireless communications
- 5G/6G D2D network design
- Link budget estimation
